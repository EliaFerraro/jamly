# Jamly — Documentation

This folder is the project's memory. Code says *what* Jamly does; these documents say *why*.

Everything here is versioned in git alongside the app. If a decision changes, the document changes with it — a stale document is worse than no document.

## How to read this

**New to the project?** Read in this order: [Vision](business/01-vision.md) → [Positioning](business/04-positioning.md) → [MVP Scope](product/11-mvp-scope.md) → [Architecture](tech/30-architecture.md).

**About to build something?** Check [MVP Scope](product/11-mvp-scope.md) and [Design Principles](design/20-design-principles.md) first.

**Have a new feature idea?** Do not start building it. Put it in the [Feature Inventory](product/10-feature-inventory.md).

## Business — why this exists and how it could sustain itself

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [01 — Vision](business/01-vision.md) | The full, unabridged north star. The complete ecosystem, deliberately larger than what we build first. |
| [02 — Market & Competitors](business/02-market-and-competitors.md) | Who else is in this space, what they charge, where they fail, and the gaps we can own. Sourced. |
| [03 — Personas & Jobs-To-Be-Done](business/03-personas-and-jtbd.md) | Who we build for, what they are actually trying to get done, and what they use today. |
| [04 — Positioning](business/04-positioning.md) | The one-sentence answer to "what is Jamly and why not just use BandHelper?" |
| [05 — Business Model](business/05-business-model.md) | Free now, individual Pro later. What becomes paid, what never does, and what it costs to run. |
| [06 — Risks & Open Questions](business/06-risks-and-open-questions.md) | Ranked list of what can kill this project, and the mitigation for each. |

## Product — what we build, in what order

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [10 — Feature Inventory](product/10-feature-inventory.md) | Every feature ever proposed, scored and triaged. The parking lot for new ideas. |
| [11 — MVP Scope](product/11-mvp-scope.md) | The definition of v0.1 done, as user stories with acceptance criteria. |
| [12 — Roadmap](product/12-roadmap.md) | Milestone-based release plan from v0.1 to v1.0. |
| [13 — Domain Model](product/13-domain-model.md) | The ubiquitous language. Every noun in Jamly, defined once. |
| [14 — Validation Plan](product/14-validation-plan.md) | How we test the thesis against real musicians before over-building. |

## Design — how it should feel

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [20 — Design Principles](design/20-design-principles.md) | The non-negotiable rules, most of them reactions to how competitors fail. |
| [21 — Information Architecture](design/21-information-architecture.md) | Navigation map and screen inventory. |

## Tech — how it is built

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [30 — Architecture](tech/30-architecture.md) | System diagram, client/server split, offline & sync strategy, auth. |
| [31 — Stack](tech/31-stack.md) | Every dependency and the reason it is there. |
| [32 — Data Model](tech/32-data-model.md) | Concrete schema, relations, and row-level security rules. |
| [33 — Conventions](tech/33-conventions.md) | Folder structure, naming, git and code conventions. |
| [ADRs](tech/adr/README.md) | Architecture Decision Records — the permanent ledger of significant decisions. |

## Process — how we work

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [40 — Ways of Working](process/40-ways-of-working.md) | Solo-dev cadence, definition of done, how docs stay honest. |
| [41 — Decision Log](process/41-decision-log.md) | Chronological log of smaller decisions that don't warrant an ADR. |

## Rules for these documents

1. **A decision without a written reason is not a decision.** Significant technical choices become an [ADR](tech/adr/README.md). Everything else goes in the [Decision Log](process/41-decision-log.md).
2. **Claims about the market carry a source link.** No "I think musicians want" without evidence or an explicit `ASSUMPTION:` tag.
3. **The Feature Inventory absorbs new ideas.** Scope creep is the number one risk to this project ([see 06](business/06-risks-and-open-questions.md)); the inventory is the pressure valve that keeps ideas without letting them into the sprint.
4. **Vision is allowed to be huge. Scope is not.** [01-vision](business/01-vision.md) describes the whole ecosystem on purpose. [11-mvp-scope](product/11-mvp-scope.md) is deliberately, uncomfortably small.
