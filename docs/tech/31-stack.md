# 31 — Stack

> Every dependency, and why it's here. A dependency without a reason is a liability — for a solo project, each one is something that can break, go unmaintained, or need migrating.

## Client

| Choice | Version target | Why | ADR |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Expo** | SDK 57 (`57.0.19`) | iOS + Android + web + future desktop from one codebase. Managed builds (EAS) remove native toolchain maintenance — significant for a solo dev. | [0001](adr/0001-cross-platform-expo-react-native.md) |
| **React Native** | 0.86.3 | Comes with the SDK. New Architecture (Fabric/TurboModules) is mandatory from SDK 55 — no legacy bridge option exists. | [0001](adr/0001-cross-platform-expo-react-native.md) |
| **React** | 19.2.3 | Comes with the SDK. | |
| **TypeScript** | 6.x, `strict: true` | Types are the documentation that can't rot. Non-negotiable for a project returned to after gaps. | |
| **Expo Router** | 57.x | File-based routing, familiar from web. **Deep links come free — and the invite link is the single most important flow in the product** ([R2](../business/06-risks-and-open-questions.md)). | |
| **Zustand** | 5.x | ~1KB, no boilerplate, no context gymnastics. UI state only. *(Not yet installed — added with the first stateful screen.)* | |
| **TanStack Query** | 5.x | Server-state caching, revalidation, optimistic updates. The offline-first read pattern is largely its job. | |
| **expo-sqlite** | 57.x | Local persistent cache. First-party, no extra native config. | [0003](adr/0003-offline-first-sync-strategy.md) |
| **react-native-reanimated** | 4.x | Drag-to-reorder setlists and smooth performance-mode transitions. | |
| **@shopify/flash-list** | 2.3.x | A 200-song repertoire must scroll without jank ([N1](../product/11-mvp-scope.md)). | |
| **react-native-pdf** *(or `expo-image` + a viewer)* | — | Chart display. **Evaluate during build** — PDF rendering is the least certain client dependency. | |
| **date-fns** | 4.x | Date maths without Moment's weight. Timezone-aware — bands travel. | |
| **expo-secure-store** | SDK-matched | Session token storage. | |
| **expo-keep-awake** | SDK-matched | The screen must not sleep during a show. Small dependency, large consequence. | |
| **expo-dev-client** | SDK-matched | **Required to run the app at all.** Expo Go is frozen at SDK 54 and no SDK 57 build exists, so the dev client *is* the development runtime — not an optional upgrade. | |

**Deliberately not used:**
- **A UI component library** (NativeBase, Tamagui, gluestack). The stage-readable dark theme is a differentiator ([Rule 3](../design/20-design-principles.md)); fighting a library's defaults costs more than a small in-house kit.
- **Redux / MobX.** Zustand + TanStack Query covers everything at this size.
- **A styling framework.** RN `StyleSheet` with design tokens. Fewer moving parts.
- **Expo UI universal components.** New in SDK 56 and appealing, but the design requires precise control. Revisit later.

## Backend

| Choice | Why | ADR |
|---|---|---|
| **Supabase** | Postgres + Auth + Realtime + Storage + RLS in one managed platform. The realtime and row-level-security pieces are exactly what Jamly needs, and are the two hardest things to build alone. | [0002](adr/0002-backend-supabase-postgres.md) |
| **PostgreSQL** | Real SQL. Genuine fullstack learning value, and relational data is the right shape for bands↔songs↔setlists. | [0002](adr/0002-backend-supabase-postgres.md) |
| **Supabase Auth** | Magic link. No password flows to build or support. | |
| **Supabase Realtime** | Broadcast channels for live setlist sync — the ephemeral-by-design transport this feature needs. | [0004](adr/0004-realtime-setlist-sync-transport.md) |
| **Supabase Storage** | Private buckets for charts. Legally mandatory that these are private. | [0007](adr/0007-copyright-user-generated-charts-only.md) |
| **Supabase CLI** | Local development and versioned migrations. **Schema is never edited in the dashboard.** | |

**Deliberately not used:** Firebase (NoSQL fits this relational domain badly, and teaches less); a custom Node/Nest API (nothing needs it yet); Appwrite/PocketBase (smaller ecosystems, more to operate).

## Tooling

| Choice | Why |
|---|---|
| **ESLint** + `eslint-config-expo` | Catches the boring mistakes |
| **Prettier** | Formatting is not worth a decision |
| **Jest** (`jest-expo` preset) + React Native Testing Library | Standard for RN; component tests where they earn their keep |
| **babel-preset-expo** | Required explicitly as a devDependency for the Jest transform — it is not resolvable transitively |
| **Maestro** | E2E on real device flows, simple YAML |
| **GitHub Actions** | Typecheck + lint + test on every PR |
| **EAS Build / EAS Update** | Cloud builds without local Xcode/Android SDK pain; OTA updates for JS-only fixes |

## Accounts & costs

| Service | Cost |
|---|---|
| Supabase | Free tier during Phase 1; ~$25/mo if it outgrows it |
| Expo EAS | Free tier sufficient at this cadence |
| Apple Developer | **€99/year** — required to ship to iOS. Budget before launch, not at launch |
| Google Play | $25 one-time |
| GitHub | Free |
| Domain | ~€15/year once the name is confirmed ([R10](../business/06-risks-and-open-questions.md)) |

**Phase 1 target: €0/month running cost**, with the Apple fee the only unavoidable outlay before an iOS launch ([05-business-model](../business/05-business-model.md)).

## Version policy

- **Expo uses unified versioning from SDK 57**: first-party packages carry the SDK's major
  version (`expo-router@57.x`, `expo-sqlite@57.x`), not independent version lines. Don't
  hand-write these — `npx expo install` resolves them.
- **Pin the Expo SDK.** Upgrade deliberately, one SDK at a time, never mid-milestone.
- Let `expo install` choose versions for Expo-managed packages — it resolves SDK-compatible ones.
- Renovate/Dependabot for security patches only. Chasing minor versions is not progress.
- **Every dependency added must be justified in this table.** If it isn't worth a row here, it isn't worth shipping.
