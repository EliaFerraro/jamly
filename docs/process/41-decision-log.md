## 2026-09-01 — Project founded

| # | Decision | Why | See |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | **Beachhead: the gigging band**, not solo players or music schools | Sharpest pain, real willingness to pay, built-in distribution through band members | [ADR-0006](../tech/adr/0006-beachhead-gigging-band.md) |
| D2 | **Stack: Expo / React Native + TypeScript** | One codebase for iOS/Android/tablet/web; leverages existing React skill; solo-dev constraint | [ADR-0001](../tech/adr/0001-cross-platform-expo-react-native.md) |
| D3 | **Backend: Supabase + Postgres**, no custom API server in v0.1 | Relational data, RLS as the security boundary, realtime included, real SQL learning | [ADR-0002](../tech/adr/0002-backend-supabase-postgres.md) |
| D4 | **Free with no limits now; individual Pro later** | Multiplayer product — price friction multiplies by band size; nothing validated yet | [ADR-0005](../tech/adr/0005-monetization-free-now-pro-later.md) |
| D5 | **All content user-uploaded and band-private. No public chart library, ever.** | NMPA/MPA enforcement precedent (OLGA's 34,000 tabs deleted); active campaign against unlicensed apps | [ADR-0007](../tech/adr/0007-copyright-user-generated-charts-only.md) |
| D6 | **v0.1 wedge is the rehearsal-to-gig loop** — repertoire → setlist → live sync → done | Scope collapse is the top risk; six pillars at once ships nothing | [11-mvp-scope](../product/11-mvp-scope.md) |
| D7 | **The passive band member is the primary design persona**, not the band leader | The incumbent's documented failure is that bandmates never adopt it | [03-personas](../business/03-personas-and-jtbd.md), [20-design-principles](../design/20-design-principles.md) |
| D8 | **`song_personal` exists in v0.1** despite carrying only notes | Establishes the band↔personal seam that the entire v0.2+ moat depends on; retrofitting it later would be a re-architecture | [13-domain-model](../product/13-domain-model.md) |
| D9 | **Entitlement abstraction and storage measurement built in v0.1**, while everything is free | Makes the Phase 2 switch a config change; you can't price what you never measured | [ADR-0005](../tech/adr/0005-monetization-free-now-pro-later.md) |
| D10 | **North-star metric is *active bands*, never total users** | A user count would hide the exact failure mode we fear most — one member per band using it | [14-validation-plan](../product/14-validation-plan.md) |
| D11 | **Songs are band-scoped, not a global catalogue** | Enormous simplification, and it keeps every chart inside a private band boundary. A global catalogue is a different, licence-encumbered product | [13-domain-model](../product/13-domain-model.md) |
| D12 | **Five tabs: Band · Repertoire · Dates · Setlists · Me** — expected to survive to v1.0 | Matches how bands actually think; a new tab per release would signal sprawl rather than depth | [21-information-architecture](../design/21-information-architecture.md) |
| D13 | **"Me" tab ships in v0.1 nearly empty** | Reserves the home for the personal layer so v0.2 is additive, not a redesign | [21-information-architecture](../design/21-information-architecture.md) |
| D14 | **No band chat feature. Ever, probably.** | Competing with the group chat the band already loves is unwinnable. Jamly takes the *structured* things out of chat and leaves the conversation there | [10-feature-inventory F213](../product/10-feature-inventory.md) |
| D15 | **Music wiki / discovery pillar deferred to v1.0+**, entering via "where this song comes from" on existing repertoire | It's an editorial cost, not an engineering one, and it's the least validated pillar. Attach context to songs bands already play rather than building an encyclopedia | [12-roadmap](../product/12-roadmap.md) |
| D16 | **Music-school / teacher edition deferred indefinitely** | A real market with a different product, a different buyer and a sales motion. Furthest from the vision and from the developer's own world | [03-personas anti-personas](../business/03-personas-and-jtbd.md) |
| D17 | **No UI component library; small in-house kit on design tokens** | The stage-readable dark theme is a product differentiator; fighting a library's defaults would cost more than building the pieces we need | [31-stack](../tech/31-stack.md) |
| D18 | **Live sync uses ephemeral broadcast, with no database table** | A lost live session must never touch durable data; broadcast is the right primitive for transient state | [ADR-0004](../tech/adr/0004-realtime-setlist-sync-transport.md) |
| D19 | **Pre-committed decision rules written before the validation interviews** | So the results can't be rationalized after the fact. The plan is allowed to be wrong — but only if we let the data say so | [14-validation-plan](../product/14-validation-plan.md) |
| D20 | **Name "Jamly" kept; trademark checks deferred but tracked** | No music-app collision found; one unrelated company on Crunchbase. Cheap to resolve pre-launch, expensive after | [04-positioning](../business/04-positioning.md), [R10](../business/06-risks-and-open-questions.md) |

## 2026-09-01 — Scaffold built

| # | Decision | Why | See |
|---|---|---|---|
| D21 | **Expo SDK 57**, not 56 | 57 is the current stable release (RN 0.86.3, React 19.2.3, TypeScript 6). Desk research had said 56; the toolchain corrected it. From SDK 57 Expo uses **unified versioning** — first-party packages carry the SDK major (`expo-router@57.x`), so versions must come from `npx expo install`, never hand-written | [31-stack](../tech/31-stack.md) |
| D22 | **`babel-preset-expo` declared as an explicit devDependency** | Not resolvable transitively; the Jest transform fails without it | [31-stack](../tech/31-stack.md) |
| D23 | **Zustand documented but not yet installed** | The stack doc's own rule: a dependency without a current use is a liability. It arrives with the first screen that needs UI state | [31-stack](../tech/31-stack.md) |
| D24 | **`.gitignore` hardened to exclude `.env`** | The Expo template ignores only `.env*.local`, which would have let a real `.env` with Supabase keys be committed | — |
| D25 | **`Placeholder` component is a developer marker, not an empty state** | Empty states are a user-facing design problem with their own rule (never assign the user homework). Conflating the two would have smuggled an anti-pattern into the design system | [20-design-principles](../design/20-design-principles.md) |

## 2026-09-02 — Development runtime

| # | Decision | Why | See |
|---|---|---|---|
| D26 | **EAS development build is the dev runtime; Expo Go is not usable** | Expo Go on both stores is frozen at SDK 54 and Expo ships no SDK 57 build — it is now positioned as a learning tool. Downgrading the project to 54 to regain Expo Go was rejected: it would forfeit RN 0.86 / New Architecture and contradict the SDK 57 pin (D21). `expo-dev-client` added; `eas.json` defines `development` / `preview` / `production` profiles. Cloud builds keep the machine free of the Android toolchain, as [ADR-0001](../tech/adr/0001-cross-platform-expo-react-native.md) already assumed | [31-stack](../tech/31-stack.md) |

## 2026-09-05 — Backend environment

A local Supabase stack (Docker + WSL) was built, seeded and verified first, then
deliberately abandoned the same day. Recorded because the reasoning matters more
than the outcome, and because the reversal itself was the decision.

| # | Decision | Why | See |
|---|---|---|---|
| D27 | **Supabase Cloud is the only backend. No local stack, no Docker, no WSL.** | The point of a backend right now is to be reachable *from a phone*. A local stack is reachable from the dev machine and then needs a LAN IP for a device, `10.0.2.2` for an Android emulator, and different values again for an EAS build handed to a bandmate. One hosted project removes that whole class of environment juggling, and removes ~7 GB of images and a 4 GB WSL VM from the machine. Accepted cost: no offline development, migrations run against a live database, and a free-tier project pauses after a week idle | `.env.example` |
| D28 | **The schema starts empty.** `0001_init.sql` and `seed.sql` were deleted rather than pushed to the cloud project | Every table should be introduced deliberately, as the feature that needs it is built, rather than inherited wholesale from a document. The 463-line schema is not lost — it is in git at `88b39e7` and can be reintroduced a table at a time. Note the seed could never have run on a hosted project anyway: it writes directly to `auth.users`, which only the local stack permits | git `88b39e7` |
| D29 | **The app is one screen: a connection check.** The tab skeleton, join route and performance route were removed | v0.0 has exactly one thing worth knowing — can the device reach the database. Screens for features that do not exist made that answer harder to see, not easier | `app/index.tsx` |
| D30 | **The health probe selects from a table that deliberately does not exist, and classifies on HTTP status, never on the error code** | With no tables there is nothing legitimate to select, but a `PGRST205` still proves the gateway authenticated the key and PostgREST answered from a schema cache built by reading Postgres. Status is the only trustworthy signal: postgrest-js does not throw when a request never lands (status `0`), and a rejected key returns a **null** error code (status `401`) — so branching on the code blames the network for what is really a bad key. Both shapes are pinned by tests | `src/features/health/` |

## 2026-09-09 — Sign-in

| # | Decision | Why | See |
|---|---|---|---|
| D31 | **Email + password is the way in, and sign-up is disabled** | Both passwordless methods need a transactional email provider before anyone can sign in once, and auth blocks every other v0.1 story. Email OTP stays the target and reuses everything built here | [ADR-0008](../tech/adr/0008-email-password-auth-now-otp-later.md) |
| D32 | **The session lives in the OS keystore, split across numbered entries** | A refresh token is a bearer credential and belongs in the Keychain / EncryptedSharedPreferences, never in AsyncStorage. But SecureStore documents a 2048-byte ceiling on Android and a Supabase session is routinely larger, so the value is chunked behind a small index. The index carries the expected length, which is what makes a torn write detectable rather than silently corrupt | `src/lib/secureStorage.ts` |
| D33 | **Percent-encode before chunking** | Chunking by character length is only chunking by byte length if every character is one byte. A display name in Japanese would put ~5400 bytes into an "1800-character" chunk and hit the limit the chunking exists to avoid | `src/lib/secureStorage.ts` |
| D34 | **Route guards, not redirects.** `Stack.Protected` decides which half of the app exists; no screen navigates on auth state | A screen that pushes a route after signing in is a second source of truth for "am I signed in", and the two disagree the first time a token expires. Expo Router removes a guarded route from the navigator entirely, so there is no signed-out state in which the app's screens are merely hidden | `app/_layout.tsx` |
| D35 | **The query cache is cleared on sign-out** | Every cached row was fetched under the previous identity. On a tablet shared between bandmates, keeping it shows one musician's data to the next one to sign in | `src/features/auth/AuthProvider.tsx` |
| D36 | **A wrong password and an unknown account get the identical answer** | Distinguishing them turns the sign-in screen into a way to enumerate who has a Jamly account, and helps nobody: the musician who typo'd their address is not served by either message | `src/features/auth/api/authErrors.ts` |
| D37 | **No password-strength rule on the sign-in field.** Strength is enforced server-side, in the dashboard | A minimum length checked at sign-in locks out whoever chose their password before the rule existed, and publishes the shape of every password in the system. Strength belongs where a password is chosen | [ADR-0008](../tech/adr/0008-email-password-auth-now-otp-later.md) |
| D38 | **`profiles` is the first table, and `plan` is not writable by the client** | The row-level-security policy decides which *row* a musician may edit; a column-level grant decides which *columns*. Without it, a client with a perfectly valid session could set its own `plan` to `pro` — a distinction that stops being academic the moment money is involved | `supabase/migrations/20260909220000_profiles.sql` |
| D39 | **The token refresh timer runs only in the foreground** | Left running, it wakes the app to renew a token nobody is using. A phone in a gig bag through a four-hour load-in should be asleep | `src/features/auth/AuthProvider.tsx` |
| D40 | **Trigger functions live in a `private` schema, never in `public`** | Everything in `public` is a PostgREST endpoint, so a `security definer` trigger function there is callable as `/rest/v1/rpc/…` by anyone holding the publishable key. Caught by `supabase db advisors`, which is now worth running after every migration. Moving them out is more durable than revoking `execute` grant by grant — a schema nobody is exposed to cannot be forgotten | `supabase/migrations/20260909223000_…sql` |
| D41 | **Auth configuration is `config.toml` + `config push`, not dashboard clicks** | Same reasoning as migrations: an untracked dashboard change is drift nobody can reconstruct. `config pull` was run first so the file is a true record of the project, and `config diff` shows exactly what a push would change. Two settings are declared so far — signups off, minimum password length 10 | `supabase/config.toml` |

| O3 | Exact Pro price point | Validation Q5 + Phase 2 timing | Phase 2 |
| O4 | Whether to offer a lifetime/founder tier at the Phase 1→2 transition | Community size and sentiment at that point | Phase 2 |
