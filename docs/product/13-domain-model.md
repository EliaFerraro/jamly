# 13 — Domain Model

> The **ubiquitous language** of Jamly. These names are used identically in conversation, in the UI, in the TypeScript types (`src/types/`) and in the database ([32-data-model](../tech/32-data-model.md)). When they drift, bugs and bad UX follow.
>
> **Rule:** use musicians' words, not software words. A `Setlist` is never a `Playlist`. An `Event` is never a `Task`.

## The central idea: two layers on one object

Everything that makes Jamly different comes from this one structural decision:

```
                    ┌───────────────────────────────┐
                    │           SONG                │
                    │  (the band's shared truth)    │
                    │  title, artist, key, tempo,   │
                    │  duration, status, charts     │
                    └───────────────┬───────────────┘
                                    │
              ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┐
              │                     │                     │
     ┌────────▼────────┐   ┌────────▼────────┐   ┌────────▼────────┐
     │  SongPersonal   │   │  SongPersonal   │   │  SongPersonal   │
     │    (Marco)      │   │     (Sara)      │   │     (Luca)      │
     │  my notes       │   │  my notes       │   │  my notes       │
     │  my confidence  │   │  my confidence  │   │  my confidence  │
     │  my chart       │   │  my chart       │   │  my chart       │
     │  my practice ───┼───┼─── log ─────────┼───┼─── history      │
     └─────────────────┘   └─────────────────┘   └─────────────────┘
        band layer above ─── personal layer below
```

The band layer is what everyone agreed on. The personal layer is what only you see. **No competitor holds both** ([02-market Gap 2](../business/02-market-and-competitors.md)), and the personal layer is where v0.2's practice features and the entire long-term moat plug in.

This is why `SongPersonal` exists in v0.1 even though it only carries notes at first ([story B5](11-mvp-scope.md)).

## Core entities (v0.1)

### `User`
A person. Exists independently of any band — Jamly follows the musician, not the group. A user may belong to several bands (multi-band is v0.2, but the model supports it from day one).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | |
| `email` | string | Auth identity. Magic link only, no password |
| `display_name` | string? | Optional, asked once inline |
| `avatar_url` | string? | |
| `plan` | enum | `free_unlimited` in Phase 1. Exists now so Phase 2 is config, not refactor |
| `plan_grandfathered_at` | timestamp | Enforces the [migration rule](../business/05-business-model.md) |
| `created_at` | timestamp | |

### `Band`
A group of musicians who play together. The unit of sharing, and the unit of the north-star metric.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | |
| `name` | string | The only required field to exist |
| `invite_code` | string | Powers the link-join flow. Rotatable |
| `created_by` | uuid → User | |
| `created_at` | timestamp | |

> A band exists with **only a name**. Every other attribute (genre, logo, description) is deliberately absent — each one is a field Marco must fill before getting value ([R2](../business/06-risks-and-open-questions.md)).

### `BandMembership`
The join between User and Band, carrying role and instruments. A user's identity *within* a band.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | |
| `band_id` / `user_id` | uuid | Unique together |
| `role` | enum | `leader` \| `member`. Leaders can edit shared data and drive live sync |
| `instruments` | string[] | Free-form (`"drums"`, `"bass"`, `"vox"`). Not an enum — musicians play things we didn't anticipate |
| `joined_at` | timestamp | |

### `Song`
A song **in a band's repertoire**. Not a global song record.

> **Deliberate decision:** songs are scoped to a band, not shared globally. Two bands playing "Superstition" have two `Song` rows. This costs some duplication and buys enormous simplicity — plus it keeps every chart inside a private band boundary ([ADR-0007](../tech/adr/0007-copyright-user-generated-charts-only.md)). A global song catalogue would be an entirely different, licence-encumbered product.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | |
| `band_id` | uuid → Band | |
| `title` / `artist` | string | Title required; artist strongly encouraged |
| `song_key` | string? | `"Bb"`, `"Am"`. Text, not an enum — modal and unusual keys exist. Named `song_key` because `key` is reserved in too many contexts |
| `tempo_bpm` | int? | |
| `duration_seconds` | int? | Feeds setlist running-time |
| `status` | enum | `learning` \| `rehearsing` \| `ready` \| `retired` |
| `notes` | text? | **Band-shared** notes — arrangement, cues, endings. Distinct from personal notes |
| `created_by` / `created_at` | | |

### `Chart`
A file attached to a song: PDF, image, later ChordPro text. **Always private to its band.**

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | |
| `song_id` / `band_id` | uuid | `band_id` denormalized for RLS and storage-quota queries |
| `kind` | enum | `pdf` \| `image` \| `chordpro` (v0.3) |
| `storage_path` | string | Private bucket. Never a public URL |
| `title` | string? | e.g. `"Bass chart"` |
| `for_instrument` | string? | Enables per-member charts (v0.2, `F112`) |
| `size_bytes` | int | **Recorded from day one** — storage is the real cost driver ([05](../business/05-business-model.md)) |
| `uploaded_by` / `created_at` | | |

### `SongPersonal` ⭐ *the seam*
One row per (song × user). The personal layer.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | |
| `song_id` / `user_id` | uuid | Unique together |
| `notes` | text? | Private. Never visible to bandmates — enforced by RLS |
| `confidence` | int? | 1–5, self-rated. Unused in v0.1 UI, **modelled now** because v0.2's practice list and the "are we ready?" view depend on it |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | |

### `Event`
Something the band does at a time and place. Rehearsals and gigs are the same entity with a type — they share every field that matters, and splitting them would double the code for no gain.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | |
| `band_id` | uuid → Band | |
| `type` | enum | `rehearsal` \| `gig` (later: `recording`, `writing`) |
| `title` | string? | Defaults from type + venue |
| `starts_at` | timestamptz | Timezone-aware — bands travel |
| `ends_at` | timestamptz? | |
| `venue_name` / `venue_address` | string? | |
| `load_in_at` | timestamptz? | Gigs |
| `notes` | text? | |
| `fee_amount` / `fee_currency` | | **v0.3** — modelled here, not exposed in v0.1 |
| `created_by` / `created_at` | | |

### `EventAttendance`
Who's coming. One row per (event × user).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `event_id` / `user_id` | uuid | Unique together |
| `status` | enum | `yes` \| `no` \| `maybe` \| `unanswered` |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | |

### `Setlist`
The ordered plan of what gets played at an event.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | |
| `band_id` / `event_id` | uuid | One setlist per event in v0.1; the model allows several (templates, `F116`) |
| `name` | string? | |
| `created_by` / `updated_at` | | |

### `SetlistItem`
A position in a setlist. Either a song or a break — modelling breaks as items is what makes running-time arithmetic work.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | |
| `setlist_id` | uuid | |
| `song_id` | uuid? | Null when `kind = break` |
| `kind` | enum | `song` \| `break` \| `set_marker` |
| `position` | int | Order within the setlist |
| `set_number` | int | Which set (1, 2, …) — drives per-set totals |
| `label` | string? | For breaks/markers: `"Break"`, `"Encore"` |
| `notes` | string? | Performance note: `"straight into the next one"` |
| `override_key` | string? | When this song is played in a different key tonight |

### `LiveSession` — ephemeral
The live sync state during a rehearsal or show. **Not durable data.** It's a realtime channel keyed by event, carrying the leader's current position.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `event_id` | uuid | Channel key |
| `current_item_id` | uuid | Where the leader is now |
| `driver_user_id` | uuid | Who's driving |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | |

> Modelled as transient state, not a table, in v0.1 ([ADR-0004](../tech/adr/0004-realtime-setlist-sync-transport.md)). If the session dies, the setlist is untouched — losing a live session must never risk the band's actual data.

## Future entities (modelled, not built)

Listed so the v0.1 schema doesn't paint us into a corner.

| Entity | Release | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `PracticeSession` | v0.2 | user × song? × duration × date × notes. Powers `F401`/`F404` |
| `PracticeItem` | v0.2 | Generated from an upcoming setlist + low `SongPersonal.confidence`. **The ⭐ feature `F403`** |
| `Payout` | v0.3 | event × user × amount × paid_at. Answers "who's been paid" |
| `Expense` | v0.3 | band × amount × paid_by × split |
| `GearSetup` | v0.4 | user × instrument × structured values × photos × public flag |
| `Venue` | ? | Promoted from `Event.venue_name` once repetition proves it's worth it |

---

## Naming conventions

| Concept | We say | We never say |
|---|---|---|
| The ordered plan for a show | **Setlist** | Playlist, Program, Queue |
| A song in the band's list | **Song** (in the **Repertoire**) | Track, Item, Piece |
| Sheet music or a chord sheet | **Chart** | Score, Document, Attachment |
| A rehearsal or gig | **Event** | Booking, Appointment, Task |
| The people in a band | **Members** | Users, Participants, Collaborators |
| The stage view during a show | **Performance mode** | Presentation mode, Live view |

Database: `snake_case`, plural tables (`songs`, `setlist_items`). TypeScript: `PascalCase` types, `camelCase` fields, mapped at the data layer ([33-conventions](../tech/33-conventions.md)).

---

## Invariants

Rules the system must never violate. Each becomes a database constraint or an RLS policy ([32-data-model](../tech/32-data-model.md)).

1. A `User` sees data from a `Band` **only** through an active `BandMembership`. Enforced at the database, never in the client. *(N7)*
2. A `Chart` file is reachable **only** by members of its band. No public URLs, ever.
3. `SongPersonal.notes` is visible to exactly one user — its owner. Bandmates included in "no one else".
4. A `Setlist` belongs to one `Event`; an `Event` belongs to one `Band`. No cross-band references anywhere.
5. Deleting a `Song` must not orphan `SetlistItem`s — cascade or soft-delete, never a dangling reference.
6. Every `Band` has at least one `leader`. The last leader cannot leave without promoting someone.
7. A `LiveSession` is ephemeral. Its loss never alters durable data.
