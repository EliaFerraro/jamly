# 10 — Feature Inventory

> **This document is the pressure valve.** Scope collapse is the number one risk to this project ([R1](../business/06-risks-and-open-questions.md)). Every new idea gets written here **immediately**, and is then not built until it earns a place in [11-mvp-scope](11-mvp-scope.md) or [12-roadmap](12-roadmap.md).
>
> Adding a row here is free and always allowed. Building a row is not.

## How to use this

**New idea?** Add a row. Don't discuss it, don't estimate it, don't build it. Just capture it with an honest first guess at value and effort, and move on.

**Legend**

- **Value** — how much a target persona would care: `high` / `med` / `low`
- **Effort** — `S` (days) / `M` (1–2 weeks) / `L` (weeks) / `XL` (months, or needs research)
- **Conf.** — confidence that this is genuinely wanted: `high` / `med` / `low` (`low` = needs [validation](14-validation-plan.md))
- **MoSCoW** — Must / Should / Could / Won't *for the release named in Rel.*
- **Rel.** — target release, or `?` if unassigned, or `—` for explicitly rejected

## Pillar 1 — Repertoire, charts & live sync

| # | Feature | Persona | Value | Effort | Conf. | MoSCoW | Rel. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F101 | Band repertoire: song list with title, artist, key, tempo, duration | P1 | high | M | high | **Must** | v0.1 |

| F119 | Public chart library across bands | — | — | — | — | **Won't** | **—** |

> **F119 is permanently rejected** on legal grounds, not product grounds. See [ADR-0007](../tech/adr/0007-copyright-user-generated-charts-only.md) and [R3](../business/06-risks-and-open-questions.md). If this idea resurfaces, the answer is still no.

## Pillar 2 — Band logistics & economy

| # | Feature | Persona | Value | Effort | Conf. | MoSCoW | Rel. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F201 | Create a band, invite by link, join in <30s | P1 P2 | high | M | high | **Must** | v0.1 |
| F202 | Member roles (leader / member) and instruments | P1 | high | S | high | **Must** | v0.1 |

| F216 | Multi-band support for one user | P3 | high | M | high | Should | v0.2 |
| F217 | Substitute/dep musician temporary access | P1 | med | M | low | Could | ? |

> **F213 (band chat) is a trap.** Jamly does not need to replace WhatsApp, and competing with a chat app the band already loves is unwinnable. Jamly wins by making the *structured* things (dates, sets, money) not live in chat. Keep the chat; take the chaos.

## Pillar 3 — Gear & studio setup

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F401 | Log a practice session (song, duration, notes) | P3 | high | S | high | **Must** | v0.2 |

| F410 | Practice session recording (audio) | P3 | med | L | low | Could | ? |
| F411 | Practice reminders / notifications | P3 | med | S | med | Could | v0.3 |

> **F403 is the differentiating feature of the entire product.** Nothing else in this inventory is unavailable to a competitor. See [02-market §Gap 2](../business/02-market-and-competitors.md).

## Pillar 5 — Discovery & culture

| # | Feature | Persona | Value | Effort | Conf. | MoSCoW | Rel. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F501 | Music wiki: history, genres, artists | P3 | med | XL | **low** | Could | v1.0+ |
| F502 | "Where this song comes from" context on repertoire songs | P3 | high | L | low | Could | v1.0+ |

| F506 | Integration with music metadata APIs (MusicBrainz, Discogs) | P3 | med | M | med | Could | v1.0+ |

> Pillar 5 is the least validated and most expensive pillar in the product. It is content, not software — its real cost is editorial, not engineering. **F502 is the smart entry point**: attach context to songs the band already plays rather than building an encyclopedia nobody opens.

## Cross-cutting / platform

| F616 | Crash reporting | med | S | high | Should | v0.2 |

> **F613 and F614 are v0.1 Musts despite the product being free.** They cost almost nothing now and make the Phase 2 switch a configuration change instead of a refactor. See [05-business-model](../business/05-business-model.md).
