# 21 — Information Architecture

> Navigation map and screen inventory for v0.1. Structure follows how bands think ([Rule 5](20-design-principles.md)): *the band → what we play → when we're playing → tonight's set → and me*.

---

## Top-level navigation

Five tabs. Not four, not seven — these are the five nouns a band actually has.

```
┌──────────┬────────────┬───────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│   Band   │ Repertoire │   Dates   │ Setlists │    Me    │
│  (home)  │            │           │          │          │
└──────────┴────────────┴───────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
     ▲
  default tab — answers "what's next" with zero taps
```

| Tab | Answers | Primary persona |
|---|---|---|
| **Band** | *What's happening and who's in?* | P2 Sara |
| **Repertoire** | *What do we play?* | P1 Marco |
| **Dates** | *When are we playing?* | P1 + P2 |
| **Setlists** | *What are we playing on Saturday?* | P1 Marco |
| **Me** | *My stuff* — notes now, practice later | P3 Luca |

**Performance mode is not a tab.** It's a full-screen takeover launched from a setlist — because on stage, tab bars are wasted pixels and accidental taps.

**Why "Me" exists in v0.1** even though it holds almost nothing: it reserves the place where the personal layer lives, so v0.2's practice features have a home rather than being wedged in later ([13-domain-model](../product/13-domain-model.md)).

## Screen inventory (v0.1)

### Entry & onboarding

| Screen | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Welcome` | First open, unauthenticated | One line of what Jamly is, one button |
| `SignIn` | Email → magic link | No password field, ever |
| `CheckEmail` | Waiting for the link | Resend option |
| `JoinBand` | Landing from an invite link ⭐ | The most important screen in the product. Band name + who invited you + one button |
| `CreateBand` | Start a band | **Name only.** Ends by presenting the invite link immediately |
| `InviteMembers` | Share the link | Reachable from Band tab at all times, never buried |

> The join path must survive the worst case: a link tapped by someone with no account, no app installed, on Android, in a car park. Store → install → deep link → joined.

### Band tab

| Screen | Purpose | Key content |
|---|---|---|
| `BandHome` ⭐ | **The default screen.** What's next | Next event (large), one-tap availability, its setlist, member list. Zero taps to value |
| `BandSettings` | Name, invite link, leave band | Sparse on purpose |
| `MemberProfile` | A member's instruments and role | |

### Repertoire tab

| Screen | Purpose | Key content |
|---|---|---|
| `RepertoireList` | All the band's songs | Search, filter by status, sort. Must stay fast at 200+ songs |
| `SongDetail` | One song | Band info (key, tempo, duration, status, shared notes), charts, **my private notes** |
| `SongEdit` | Add/edit | Title + artist are enough to save |
| `ChartViewer` | A PDF or image chart | Zoom, page. Opens from `SongDetail` **and** from performance mode |

### Dates tab

| Screen | Purpose | Key content |
|---|---|---|
| `EventList` | Upcoming and past | Grouped by upcoming/past, rehearsals and gigs distinguished at a glance |
| `EventDetail` | One rehearsal or gig | When, where, load-in, notes, who's coming, its setlist |
| `EventEdit` | Add/edit | Type + date + time is enough to save |

### Setlists tab

| Screen | Purpose | Key content |
|---|---|---|
| `SetlistList` | The band's setlists | Linked to their events |
| `SetlistDetail` | View a set | Numbered, per-song key and duration, per-set and total running time. **Read-only for non-leaders** |
| `SetlistEdit` | Build a set | Pick from repertoire, drag to reorder, add breaks and set markers |
| `PerformanceMode` ⭐ | **Full-screen, on stage** | Huge current song, next song secondary, sync indicator, detach/attach, one tap to the chart |

### Me tab

| Screen | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MyProfile` | Display name, avatar, instruments |
| `MyNotes` | All my personal song notes in one place |
| `Settings` | Theme, notifications, sign out, **data export**, about |

## Key flows

### Flow 1 — Join a band ⭐ *the flow that decides everything*

```
 tap link → [store → install] → JoinBand → SignIn → BandHome
                                              ↑        ↑
                                 folded in, not a wall │
                                                       │
                        real content, never an empty state
```
**Budget: < 30 seconds, ≤ 4 taps.** Measured, not estimated ([N5](../product/11-mvp-scope.md)).

### Flow 2 — Book a gig and build its set
```
 Dates → + → EventEdit (type, date, venue) → EventDetail
   → "Build setlist" → SetlistEdit (pick, drag, breaks) → done
```
The setlist is created **from the event**, not separately. Bands think "the set for Saturday", never "a setlist that I'll later assign".

### Flow 3 — Play a show
```
 BandHome → next event → "Start performance" → PerformanceMode
   → leader advances → every device follows
   → any member: chart (1 tap) · detach (1 tap) · re-attach (1 tap)
```
Nothing in this flow may require typing, precision, or more than 3 taps.

### Flow 4 — Prepare at home
```
 Repertoire → SongDetail → chart + my private notes
```
Small in v0.1 — and it's the seed of v0.2, where the same screen gains practice logging and confidence.

## Navigation rules

1. **The Band tab is home.** Launching the app always lands there.
2. **Performance mode is a takeover**, entered deliberately and exited deliberately. No tab bar, no accidental navigation, screen stays awake.
3. **Deep links are first-class**: invite links, event links, setlist links. The link *is* the sharing mechanism, because the band lives in a group chat and always will.
4. **Back always works**, on both platforms, including Android's system back.
5. **No nested tabs**, no drawer plus tabs. One navigation model.
6. **Charts open modally** over whatever launched them, and return there — so a chart opened during a show returns to the show.

## Screen count

**~25 screens in v0.1.** Small enough to build alone, large enough to be a real product. If this number grows before v0.1 ships, scope has crept ([R1](../business/06-risks-and-open-questions.md)).

## Growth plan

| Release | IA change |
|---|---|
| v0.2 | **Me** tab gains practice and stats — the reason it was reserved |
| v0.2 | Band switcher in the header for multi-band |
| v0.3 | Money lives inside `EventDetail` and a band summary — not a new tab |
| v0.4 | Gear lives under **Me**, with a public browse surface — still not a sixth tab |

**The five tabs should survive to v1.0.** If a release needs a new tab, that's a signal the product is sprawling rather than deepening.
